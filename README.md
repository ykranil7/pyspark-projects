# PySpark Projects Showcase

Welcome to my PySpark Projects Showcase repository! This repository contains a collection of projects demonstrating my skills and experience with PySpark, a powerful framework for big data processing and analysis.

## Projects

### 1. Drone Pilots Salaries

This project focuses on analyzing drone pilots' shift details and calculating their salaries based on hours worked. It utilizes PySpark for data processing and analysis.

## Overview

The project performs the following steps:
- **Data Ingestion**: Reads the drone pilots' shift details from a CSV file.
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Filters relevant columns and calculates total hours worked per pilot.
- **Salary Calculation**: Calculates the salary for each pilot based on an hourly rate.
- **Output**: Saves the processed data to a new CSV file or any preferred output format.

## Getting Started
